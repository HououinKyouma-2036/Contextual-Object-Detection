The Grand Vision for this project is to develop an AR application capable of scanning any room
to identify elements that do not belong or are out of place, by leveraging advanced image
recognition and artificial intelligence technologies. The envisioned application will not only
detect anomalies but also provide detailed feedback on room optimization, enhancing both
domestic and professional environments. The ultimate goal is to seamlessly integrate this
technology into daily use cases such as crime scene analysis, interior design optimization, and
general household management, making it a ubiquitous tool for various industries.
